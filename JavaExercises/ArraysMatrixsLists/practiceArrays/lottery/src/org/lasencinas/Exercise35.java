/**
 * The Primitive Lottery is a game of chance regulated by the National Organization of State Lotteries and Bets (LAE)
 * which consists of choosing 6 different numbers between 1 and 49.
 * To win the winning combination in the corresponding draw, 6 balls are drawn from a drum.
 * In addition an extra ball is extracted as a complementary number, and another ball from a separate drum,
 * between 0 and 9, which acts as a "re-entry" number.
 * Write a program that generates 5 combinations of the primitive lottery. It has to be visualized in the way:
 *
 * Combination 1: 4, 2, 7,23,45,34 Complementary: 13 Reimbursement: 5
 *
 * Combination 2: Complementary: 12 Refund: 4
 *
 * Save the numbers in an ArrayList and "men√©alos" them using the suffle method.
