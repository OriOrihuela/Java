# Exercise 1: Basis of Inheritance
## Upcasting
1. Create two classes, a superclass called `Employee` and the subclass called `Manager`.
2. Then, see how the properties and behaviours are inherit from `Employee` to `Manager`, testing both classes.
3. Create `EmpUtil` and `UpcastTest` to check if the **Upcasting** works properly.
## Method Overloading
1. Create a class called `OverloadingTest` just to check if the **Overloading** Java concept works properly.
2. That class will work with `Employee` and `Manager` type classes.
