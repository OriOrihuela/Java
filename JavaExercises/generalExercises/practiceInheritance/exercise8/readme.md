# Field Hiding
An exercise about **Field Hiding** in Java Programming Language.
- The objecive is about creating different Java classes which there is an inheritance between them.
- After that, show if the **field hiding** concept works properly, "overriding" the properties of the classes changing their access
modifiers and values.
- It is important to know that field hiding occurs **only** based on the name of the field. Access level, data type, and the type	of field (static or non-static) are not considered for field hiding.
