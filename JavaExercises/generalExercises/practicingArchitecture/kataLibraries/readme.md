# Libraries Network
### An exercise on class architecture in Java. The main purpose is to practice different very important concepts, such as inheritance, dependency injection or polymorphism.
1. The `publicEntity` package has three Java classes: `PublicEntity` (*superclass*), `Library` and `TownHall` (*subclasses*).
2. The `person` package has three Java classes: `Person` (*superclass*), `Employee` and `Member` (*subclasses*).
